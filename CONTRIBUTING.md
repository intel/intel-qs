# Contributing

Thanks for your interest in the project! 

Any contribution, project participation and pull request from developers of all skill levels is welcome. Please follow this process:
1. create a new branch (out of the current master branch and with a descriptive name)
2. implement your changes
3. start a pull-request (merge into master branch)

Creating your pull request from a fork? We suggest allowing edits from maintainers. Then, anyone with Write access to the upstream repository will be able to add commits to your branch. This can make the review process easier for maintainers since they can make a small change themselves instead of asking you to make the change.
